abstract = {Nowadays, the field of multimedia retrieval system has earned a lot of attention as it helps retrieve information more efficiently and accelerates daily tasks. Within this context, image processing techniques such as layout analysis and word recognition play an important role in transcribing content in printed or handwritten documents into digital data that can be further processed. This transcription procedure is called document digitization. This work stems from an industrial need, namely, a Swedish company (ArkivDigital AB) has scanned more than 80 million pages of Swedish historical documents from all over the country and there is a high demand to transcribe the contents into digital data. Such process starts by figuring out text location which, seen from another angle, is merely table layout analysis. In this study, the aim is to reveal the most effective solution to extract document layout w.r.t Swedish handwritten historical documents that are featured by their tabular forms. In short, outcome of public tools (i.e., Breuel's OCRopus method), traditional image processing techniques (e.g., Hessian/Gabor filters, Hough transform, Histograms of oriented gradients -HOG- features), machine learning techniques (e.g., support vector machines, transfer learning) are studied and compared. Results show that the existing OCR tool cannot carry layout analysis task on our Swedish historical handwritten documents. Traditional image processing techniques are mildly capable of extracting the general table layout in these documents, but the accuracy is enhanced by introducing machine learning techniques. The best performing approach will be used in our future document mining research to allow for the development of scalable resource-efficient systems for big data analytics.}
