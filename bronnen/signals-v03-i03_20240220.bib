ABSTRACT = {Text line extraction is an essential preprocessing step in many handwritten document image analysis tasks. It includes detecting text lines in a document image and segmenting the regions of each detected line. Deep learning-based methods are frequently used for text line detection. However, only a limited number of methods tackle the problems of detection and segmentation together. This paper proposes a holistic method that applies Mask R-CNN for text line extraction. A Mask R-CNN model is trained to extract text lines fractions from document patches, which are further merged to form the text lines of an entire page. The presented method was evaluated on the two well-known datasets of historical documents, DIVA-HisDB and ICDAR 2015-HTR, and achieved state-of-the-art results. In addition, we introduce a new challenging dataset of Arabic historical manuscripts, VML-AHTE, where numerous diacritics are present. We show that the presented Mask R-CNN-based method can successfully segment text lines, even in such a challenging scenario.},
